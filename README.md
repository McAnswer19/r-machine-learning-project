# R_Machine_Learning_Project

A demonstration of data cleaning, visualization, and forecasting using the R programming language. 

This was part of some coursework on R programming that I took at The University of London in 2021. This project focused on creating a complete data science pipeline in R with a 
focus on cleaning, visualization, and forecasting. The dataset used was a dataset of human life expectancy, which was downloaded from Kaggle.com, and was additionally augmented 
by a dataset of human height from Our World in Data. 

To recreate the pipeline, first run the data_cleaning_R_script and then the file r_project_file. data_cleaning_R_script should work automatically with the only needed change being the directory string supplied to setwd() on line 9. r_project_file should work automatically once data_cleaning_R_script has finished running.
